function cortex_hb = spectroscopy_img(cortex_mu_a, E)

% SPECTROSCOPY_IMG Completes the Beer-Lambert law from a reconstructed
% image.
%
%   img_out = SPECTROSCOPY_IMG(img_in, E) takes the reconstructed VOX x
%   TIME x WL mua image "img_in" and multiplies it by the inverse
%   of the extinction coefficient matrix "E" to create an output VOX x TIME
%   x HB matrix "img_out", where HB 1 and 2 are the voxel-space time series
%   images for HbO and HbR, respectively.
